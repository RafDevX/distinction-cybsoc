# Distinction CybSoc

This repository is a collection of my submissions to assignments for distinction within the DD2510 Cybersecurity in a Socio-Technical Context course at KTH (HT 2023).

The following is included, for each of the course modules:

-   **Module 1 - Processes and Organization:** _N/A; work conducted in pairs and thus not present in this repository_
-   **Module 2 - Vulnerabilities in the Use of Systems:** Socio-economical incentives analysis of the 2017 Equifax Data Breach
-   **Module 3 - Threat Actors:** Report analyzing the 2022 Viasat Hack from a threat/threat actor perspective, as well as from a political and socio-technical perspective
-   **Module 4 - Cybersecurity Law:** Legal memorandum on the development of a Cybersecurity Policy for a large, public hospital within the European Union

_Note to self: this is not the files' canonical location nor their source of truth, but rather a simple after-the-fact collection of such files at a certain point in time, and it is not dynamically updated should they change in the future (which they should not)._
